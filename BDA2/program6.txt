6. Develop Pig Latin scripts to sort, group, join, project, and filter the data.

INPUT:
a. students.txt
1,John,22
2,Alice,23
3,Bob,22
4,David,24
Each line: StudentID,Name,Age
b. marks.txt
1,85
2,91
3,78
4,88
Each line: StudentID,Marks

PROGRAM:
-- Load the files
A = LOAD 'students.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (id:int, name:chararray, age:int);
B = LOAD 'marks.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (id:int, marks:int);

-- Filter students older than 22
C = FILTER A BY age > 22;

-- Select only name and age
D = FOREACH C GENERATE name, age;

-- Join student info with marks
E = JOIN A BY id, B BY id;

-- Group by age
F = GROUP A BY age;

-- Count students in each age group
G = FOREACH F GENERATE group AS age, COUNT(A) AS total;

-- Sort by age descending
H = ORDER A BY age DESC;

-- Save output
STORE D INTO 'out_filtered' USING PigStorage(',');
STORE E INTO 'out_joined' USING PigStorage(',');
STORE G INTO 'out_grouped' USING PigStorage(',');
STORE H INTO 'out_sorted' USING PigStorage(',');

OUTPUT:  pig -x local student_analysis.pig
